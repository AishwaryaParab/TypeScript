# Classes in TypeScript

``` typescript
class User {
    name: string;
    email: string;

    constructor(name: string, email: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
}

const aish = new User("Aishwarya Parab", "aish@gmail.com")
```

## Private & Public in TS

**readonly** will allow you to **access** the property but won't allow you to **set** the property. 

On the other hand, private won't allow you to do both - accessing as well as setting. We can use a private variable only inside that class. 

``` typescript
class User {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    private city: string = "Panjim";

    constructor(name: string, email: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
}

const aish = new User("Aishwarya Parab", "aish@gmail.com")

// aish.city // not allowed
// aish.city = "Porvorim" // not allowed
```

All the properties are by default **"public"**.

The **private** and **publi**c keywords are present in **TS** only. These are not present in **JS**. In JS, **private** is represented by the **"#"** symbol before the property.

## A Professional Way of Declaring Classes

``` typescript
// A Professional Way of Declaring Classes

class User2 {
    private city: string = "Panjim"

    constructor(
        public name: string,
        public email: string
    ) {

    }
}

const shri = new User2("Shridhar Maskeri", "shri@gmail.com");
```

## Getters and Setters

``` typescript
class User2 {
    private city: string = "Panjim";
    private courseCount: number = 1;

    constructor(
        public name: string,
        public email: string
    ) {

    }

    get getAppleEmail(): string {
        return `apple${this.email}`
    }

    get getCourseCount(): number {
        return this.courseCount;
    }

    set setCourseCount(courseNum: number) {
        if(courseNum < 1) {
            throw new Error("Course count should be more than 1");
        }
        this.courseCount = courseNum;
    }
}

const shri = new User2("Shridhar Maskeri", "shri@gmail.com");
```

Keywords such as **"get"** and **"set"** are used for getters and setters respectively.

> Note: In the setters, there shouldn't be any return type since we're not returning anything. The return type shouldn't be void as well. Otherwise, it throws an error!

## Protected in TypeScript

``` typescript
class User2 {
    private city: string = "Panjim";
    // private courseCount: number = 1;

    protected courseCount: number = 1; 

    constructor(
        public name: string,
        public email: string
    ) {

    }

    get getAppleEmail(): string {
        return `apple${this.email}`
    }

    get getCourseCount(): number {
        return this.courseCount;
    }

    set setCourseCount(courseNum: number) {
        if(courseNum < 1) {
            throw new Error("Course count should be more than 1");
        }
        this.courseCount = courseNum;
    }
}

// Inheritance

class SubUser extends User2 {
    isFamily: boolean = true;

    changeCourseCount() {
        this.courseCount = 4;
    }

}
```

The protected property will be used as a private property in its class as well as in the child class.
