# What is TypeScript

- TypeScript does static checking for you. 
- It means that whatever code you're writing is constantly being checked as you try to write it. Pretty much like Java. 
- This is not the case in JS. JS will give you errors once you're done writing and when you're done running it. 

So, the core job of TypeScript is to analyze the code as we type. *That's it.*

Also, TS is a development tool. Your project still runs JS. Just that it helps you write better and maintainable code. 

So, by no means is TS a new programming language :-)

In order to run typescript in the browser, go to -> https://www.typescriptlang.org/play


``` javascript
let user = {name: "Aishwarya Parab", age: 22}

let email = user.email
```
The above code in javascript won't give an error during typing. But the same code written in TS will give you an error while typing. 

This is the power of TS! ðŸ’ª

## Something is fishy!

Coincidentally, the below code is allowed in TS:

``` typescript
let number1 = 3

let number2 = "3"

let sum = number1 + number2
console.log(sum)
```

We will further see how to enhance type safety to save us from such mishaps!
