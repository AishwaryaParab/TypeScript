# READONLY and Optional in TS

**Demo in objects.ts file**

<br>

## Readonly in TS

``` typescript
type ActiveUser = {
    readonly _id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    isActive: boolean
}

let myUser: ActiveUser = {
    _id: "12345",
    name: "Aishwarya",
    email: "aish@gmail.com",
    isActive: true
}

myUser.email = "aish@yahoo.com";
// myUser._id = "123"; This shouldn't be allowed as id is readonly
```

When the code is compiled into JS, JS allows the change of id. However, typescript strictly prohibits this.

## Optional in TS

To keep a few fields optional. For example, you can keep a credit card field for users but not all users will have a credit card. So, this field would be optional. 

Like this:

``` typescript
type ActiveUser = {
    readonly _id: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    isActive: boolean;
    credCardNumber?: number
}

let myUser: ActiveUser = {
    _id: "12345",
    name: "Aishwarya",
    email: "aish@gmail.com",
    isActive: true
}
```

Here **credCardNumber** is an optional field.

## Using the '&' Symbol

``` typescript
// Using the & symbol

type cardNumber = {
    cardNum: string;
}

type cardDate = {
    date: string;
}

type cardDetails = cardNumber & cardDate & {
    cvv: number
}
```

Thus, any object of cardDetails will have three properties: cardNum, date and cvv. Like this:

``` typescript
let card: cardDetails = {
    cardNum: "8765432",
    date: "13/28",
    cvv: 526,
} 
```
