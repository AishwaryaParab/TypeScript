# The in Operator Narrowing

*Demo in typeNarrow.ts file*

``` typescript
// The in Operator Narrowing

interface User {
    name: string,
    email: string
}

interface Admin {
    name: string,
    email: string,
    isAdmin: boolean
}

function isAdminAccount(account: User | Admin) {
    // return account.isAdmin;
    // We cannot straightaway use this because we're not sure whether account is User or Admin type as of now.

    if("isAdmin" in account) {
        return account.isAdmin; 

        // In this way, we're narrowing down the type of account
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

Thus, we just check for a particular property or field to be present **in** the object at hand.
