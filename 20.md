# Type Narrowing

Here are some examples that are considered to be best practices while being cautious of the type used. 

``` typescript
function detectType(val: number | string) {
    if(typeof val === "string") {
        return val.toLowerCase();
    }
    return val + 3;
}
```

``` typescript
function provideId(id: string | null) {
    if(!id) {
        console.log("Please provide ID");
        return
    }

    // do some database operations
    id.toLowerCase()
}
```

Typeof is also known as type guard which is used to be extra cautious of the type we're considering at hand.

## Another Example

``` typescript
function printAll(strs: string | string[] | null) {
    if(strs) {
        if(typeof strs === "object") {
            for(const s of strs) {
                console.log(s);
            }
        }
    } else if(typeof strs === "string") {
        console.log(strs);
    }
}
```

- The typeof of an array is an object. Therefore, we're handling the case of an array and a string.
- We're also making sure that nothing happens if strs is null. So, null case is also handled.

*But what about an empty string?*

Using the above code, we would simply print an empty string onto the console. But since we're providing business solutions, it would be better to handle this usecase separately.
