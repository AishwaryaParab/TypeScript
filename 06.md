# The ANY Keyword

``` typescript
let hero;

function getHero() {
    return "Thor";
}

hero = getHero();
```

In the above example, **hero** has **any** type because we haven't explicitly mentioned the type here. Any other developer can also *return true* instead of *return "Thor"* and you won't encounter an error!

*However, this is undesirable!*

That is why, this is the perfect place wherein we ought to specify the type of the variable used. 

Like this: 

``` typescript
let hero: String;

function getHero() {
    return "Thor";
}

hero = getHero();
```

Now, if you return something other than a String value then you will be getting an error rightaway. 

Thus, when you don't specify a type, and TypeScript can't infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to **any**.

You usually want to avoid this though, because **any** isn't type-checked.
