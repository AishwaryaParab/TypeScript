# Interface V/s Type in TypeScript

If you wish to add a new property in your interface then you don't need to touch your previous interface. For example, you don't need to touch this:

``` typescript 
interface User {
    readonly dbID: number,
    name: string,
    userId: number
    googleId?: string,
    // startTrial: () => string
    startTrial(): string  //both are right
    getCoupon(couponName: string): number
}
```

<br>

You can write the new property, like this:


``` typescript 
interface User {
    // New property
    githubToken: string
}
```

Now, a variable using the 'User' interface should have the following properties:

``` typescript 
const aish: User = {
    dbID: 155,
    name: "Aishwarya Parab",
    userId: 12345,
    startTrial: () => {
        return "Trial started."
    },
    getCoupon: (name: "aish2023") => {
        return 10679
    },
    githubToken: "github"
}
```

Thus, this is known as **Reopening the interface**.

## Extending an Interface

``` typescript 
// Extending an Interface

interface Admin extends User {
    role: "admin" | "ta" | "learner"
}

const shri: Admin = {
    dbID: 156,
    name: "Shridhar Maskeri",
    userId: 1234,
    startTrial: () => {
        return "Trial started."
    },
    getCoupon: (name: "shri2023") => {
        return 10769
    },
    githubToken: "github",
    role: "admin"
}
```

## Difference between Interface and Type

- You can reopen interfaces but the same cannot be done in type. 
- Type aliases and interfaces are very similar and in many cases, you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an **interface** are available in **type**. 
- The key distinction is that a **type** cannot be **re-opened** to add new properties vs an **interface** which is always extendable.
