# instanceof Narrowing

*Demo in typeNarrow.ts file*

instanceof is also a type guard, and TypeScript narrows in branches guarded by instanceofs. JavaScript has an operator to check whether or not a value is an instance of another value.

For example, **x instanceof Foo**

``` typescript

// The instanceof Narrowing

function logValue(x: Date | String) {
    if(x instanceof Date) {
        console.log(x.toUTCString());
    } else {
        console.log(x.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```

In the above code, we're checking if x is an instanceof Date. If yes, we're sure that x is of type **Date**. Otherwise, it is of type **String**.

The potential of using instanceof is in places wherein we would use the keyword **"new"**.

## Using Type Predicates

To define a user-defined type guard, we simply need to define a function whose return type is a **type predicate**. 


``` typescript
/ Using Type Predicates

type Fish = {swim: () => void}
type Bird = {fly: () => void}

function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird) {
    return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}

function getFood(pet: Fish | Bird) {
    if(isFish(pet)) {
        pet  // if you hover over this line, typescript is still confused whether pet is a fish or a bird
        return "Fish food";
    } else {
        pet
        return "Bird food";
    }
}
```

In the function, *isFish()*, we're checking if **swim** has been defined for the pet or no. If yes, then it returns **true**, otherwise, **false**.

In the *getFood()* function, if the pet is a **fish**, we return "Fish Food". However, even after writing a specific logic to determine that the pet is a fish, typescript is still confused. 

Here's where type predicates come into picture!

## Fixes

``` typescript
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
    return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
```

The above function will now return **"pet is Fish"** rather than returning a **boolean** value. Thus, hovering over pet will explicitly mention the type of pet to us!
