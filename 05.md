# Number, Boolean and Type Inference

**Impt** - *number* is for numbers like 42. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to *int* or *float* - everything is simply *number*.

``` typescript
// Number

let userId: number = 22344;

let userId2: number = 334.32;


// Boolean

let isLoggedIn: boolean = false;


export {}
```

## Type Inferencing

Since we're assigning a value to a variable, Typescript is smart to understand the type of the variable. So, we don't need to explicitly mention the type of the variable. 

Thus, 

``` typescript
let userId: number = 22344;
```

can translate to 

``` typescript
let userId = 22344;
```

This is because typescript knows the type of that variable once we assign a value to it. **This is a better practice.**
