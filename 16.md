# How to setup TypeScript for Real Projects

*Demo in projectTS folder*

Because typescript is installed globally, you can use:

``` bash
tsc --init
```

Which will generate a **tsconfig.json** file.

If, in case, typescript is not installed globally, you can use this to generate a **tsconfig.json** file.

``` bash
npx -p typescript tsc --init
```

Then,

``` bash
npm init -y
```

Which will generate a **package.json** file.

Then, create the following:

- index.html file
- two folders -> src and dist
- create an **index.ts** file in src folder and **index.js** file in dist folder
- include the script tag in index.html

``` html
<script src="./dist/index.js"></script>
```

<br>

Now, in order to tell that the typescript file (index.ts) should be compiled into index.js, we need to uncomment **"outDir": "./"**  (line no. 52) in tsconfig.json and use this instead:

``` json
 "outDir": "./dist"
```

<br>

We can now run the ts file in watch mode like this:

``` bash
tsc -w
```

Now, the respective index.js file will be created in the dist folder.

Even if there is no index.js file present inside the dist folder, running typescript in watch mode will create this file inside dist.
