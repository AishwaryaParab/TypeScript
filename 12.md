# Tuples in TS

Tuples are not used in JS but are a part of TS.

A tuple is a collection of objects which is ordered and immutable. Tuples are sequences, just like arrays. The difference between tuples and arrays is that tuples are immutable. 


``` typescript
let tupleUser: [string, number, boolean];
```

This means that the items in this tuple will appear in the following order, 1st a string then number and then a boolean type item.

Like this:

``` typescript
let tupleUser: [string, number, boolean];

tupleUser = ["Aishwarya", 123456, true]
tupleUser = ["Shridhar", 1234, false]
// tupleUser = [1234, "Rohit", false]  // order is wrong
```

If the order is wrong, you'll get an error.

## Classic Example with Colors

``` typescript
// RGB example

let rgb: [number, number, number];

rgb = [255, 255, 255];
```

## Tuples with type

``` typescript 
// Tuples with type

type User = [number, string];

let user1: User = [12345, "Aishwarya"]
```

## Problems with Tuples

``` typescript
// Problems with Tuples

user1[1] = "Shridhar";
console.log(user1);

// user1.push(1245, true);
user1.push(1245, "Rohit");
console.log(user1);
```

**Output:**

``` typescript
[ 12345, 'Shridhar' ]
[ 12345, 'Shridhar', 1245, 'Rohit' ]
```

Tuples are considered to be immutable. Thus, it shouldn't have allowed me to make a change in the first place. Secondly, I'm getting all the array methods such as **push**, **pop**, which can further mutate the tuple. 

Thus, defeating the purpose of using a tuple.
