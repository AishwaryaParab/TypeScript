# Why to learn TypeScript? 

- TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript but it doesn't necessarily have added features. 
- It makes writing code simpler, thus giving rise to lesser errors.
- The code in TypeScript is eventually converted into JavaScript. 
- TypeScript is not about reinventing the entire JS language but just to write code in a meaningful manner. 
- TypeScript may not be the right choice for smaller projects.

## TypeScript is all about Type Safety!

For example, Javascript allows me to concatenate 

``` javascript
2 + "2"
```
Output: "22"

*But this behaviour shouldn't be allowed!*

**Some more examples:**

``` javascript
null + 2
```
Output: 2

``` javascript
undefined + 2
```
Output: NaN
