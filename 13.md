# Enums in TS

- Enum is short for **Enumerations**.
- Is used when you want to restrict the choices provided.

<br>

## Using Enum

``` typescript
enum SeatChoice {
    AISLE,
    MIDDLE,
    WINDOW
}

const aishSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;
```

In the above example, there are only 3 choices of seats. 

**AISLE** has a value of 0, **MIDDLE** has a value of 1 and **WINDOW** has a value of 2 and so on. 

If you give a default value, then that value will be considered and all other subsequent values would be related to that default value. Like this:

``` typescript
enum SeatChoice {
    AISLE,
    MIDDLE = 10,
    WINDOW
}

const aishSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;
```

Here, **AISLE** has a value of 0, **MIDDLE** has a value of 10 and **WINDOW** has a value of 11 and so on.

## Different ways to write enums

``` typescript
enum SeatChoice {
    AISLE = "VIP",
    MIDDLE = 10,
    WINDOW
}

const aishSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;
```

Here, **AISLE** has a value of "aisle", **MIDDLE** has a value of 10 and **WINDOW** has a value of 11 and so on.

## Generating less code with Enums

The above code, when compiled into javascript, generates a lot of code, which is undesirable. 

``` javascript
"use strict";
var SeatChoice;
(function (SeatChoice) {
    SeatChoice["AISLE"] = "VIP";
    SeatChoice[SeatChoice["MIDDLE"] = 10] = "MIDDLE";
    SeatChoice[SeatChoice["WINDOW"] = 11] = "WINDOW";
})(SeatChoice || (SeatChoice = {}));
const aishSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;
```

Here's a fix for this. Use **const** before enum. Like this:

``` typescript
const enum SeatChoice {
    AISLE = "VIP",
    MIDDLE = 10,
    WINDOW
}

const aishSeat = SeatChoice.AISLE;
```

Now, the entire code will compiled into this:

``` javascript
"use strict";
const aishSeat = "VIP" /* SeatChoice.AISLE */;
```

Which is way better than the previous one!
